# Customer Churn Prediction using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project uses an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict customer churn (whether a customer will leave the company).  
The dataset contains customer demographic and service-related features, and the model outputs a binary classification: churn (`True`) or not churn (`False`).

The workflow includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Handling class imbalance using **SMOTE**
- Building and training an ANN model in TensorFlow/Keras
- Evaluating with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score
